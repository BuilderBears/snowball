What is this?
================

GuideMe ( *project snowball* ) is a platform for posting **topics** and receiving **suggestions** from the community. 
Users can **upvote** the suggestions they think are best. 
It's aimed at helping developers find the best documentation/blog posts/resources on a given topic, but anyone can use it for their own purposes.
Check it out live as it's being developed [here](http://guideme.herokuapp.com)
